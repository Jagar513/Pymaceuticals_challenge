# Analysis
The data depicts Capomulin has the most effective treatment for mice with SCC tumors as a notable result of the reduction of tumor size without affecting the mice's weight. This suggests that the drug is safe and effective for treatment.

As stated in the graph, the correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume with the use of Capomulin is 0.84 showing that larger mice tended to have larger tumors.

A total of 248 mice an even amount of both males and females with SCC tumors were treated in the study which shows that the experiment was done in a controlled environment to avoid bias.

Looking at how tumor volumes compare across the different treatment groups, Capomulin and Ramicane had the most effect in lowering tumor volumes. In contrast to mice treated with Infubinol and Ceftamin where mice had higher average tumor volumes.
